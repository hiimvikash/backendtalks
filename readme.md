## **1. Booking Process Flow**

Below is a structured explanation of how a flight/hotel booking works on MakeMyTrip.

### **Step 1: User Login & Selection**
* The user logs into the **MakeMyTrip** platform (via website or mobile app).
* The user selects a **flight** or **hotel** they want to book.

### **Step 2: Checkout Page**
* The user is redirected to the **checkout page**, where they review their selection and proceed with payment.

### **Step 3: Choosing Payment Method**
* The user selects **HDFC Net Banking** as the preferred payment method.

### **Step 4: Payment Gateway Redirection**
* A new **popup window** opens, redirecting the user to **HDFC Net Banking** (`netbanking.hdfc.com`) to complete the transaction.

### **Step 5: If User Closes MMT Frontend Checkout Page**
* Instead of waiting, the user **closes** the MMT **checkout page** while the payment is still in progress on the HDFC website.

### **Step 6: Payment Completion on HDFC Portal**
* The user **completes the payment** successfully on **HDFC Net Banking**.

### **Step 7: Bank Transfers Money to MMT Account**
* **HDFC Bank** transfers the **paid amount** to MakeMyTripâ€™s **bank account**.

### **Step 8: HDFC Calls MMT Webhook API**
* After the transaction is successful, **HDFC Bank** triggers a **webhook API call** to MMTâ€™s **server**.
* The webhook is a **listener** on the server that waits for payment confirmations from banks.
* The **HDFC server** sends the following **payload (data)** to MMTâ€™s webhook API:

```json
{
  "userId": 67,
  "amount": 19000,
  "flightDetails": {}
}
```

### **Step 9: MMT Webhook API Updates the Database**
* The **MMT Webhook API** processes this payment confirmation.
* It **updates the database** for the **specific userId (67)**.
* The booking details are **added to the database**, confirming the reservation.

**NOTE : Never process two withdrawl request parallely,  let the requests be reside in the queue and process each request sequentially at a time.**

## 2. Why Does MakeMyTrip (MMT) Use a Separate Webhook Server for Banks?

MMT uses a **separate webhook server** instead of merging it into the main backend for the following reasons:

## 1. Separation of Concerns  
- The main backend handles **user authentication, bookings, and searches**.  
- The webhook server **only** listens for **bank payment confirmations**.  
- Keeping them separate ensures **better structure and organization**.

## 2. High Availability & Reliability  
- Bank webhook calls **must always be processed** without failure.  
- If MMTâ€™s main backend is **slow or down**, the webhook server still works.  
- Ensures **payments are never lost** even during heavy traffic.

## 3. Security & Compliance  
- Banks require **strict security rules** for webhook handling.  
- A separate server allows **better access control** for **only trusted banks**.  
- Different security policies ensure **safer transactions**.

## 4. Asynchronous Processing  
- Webhooks work **independently** and donâ€™t need an instant response.  
- If a webhook request fails, it can **retry automatically**.  
- Prevents **delays** in the main backend.

## 5. Better Scalability  
- As bookings grow, **bank webhook traffic increases**.  
- MMT can **scale only the webhook server** instead of the entire system.  
- **Reduces costs** and **improves efficiency**.

## 6. Easier Debugging & Monitoring  
- A dedicated webhook server helps **quickly find payment issues**.  
- Logs and errors are separate from the main backend.  
- **Faster troubleshooting** for failed transactions.

### âœ… Summary  
MMT keeps a **separate webhook server** for banks to ensure **better performance, security, reliability, and scalability** while avoiding issues in the main backend. ðŸš€  

# 2. LeetCode Problem Submission Architecture
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab5cd6b-690b-4ae0-99dd-3b9f9a19ffa8)
## Overview
This document explains the flow of problem submission on LeetCode, from user submission to execution and result delivery.

## 1. User Submits Code
- A user writes and submits code via:
  - **Browser**
  - **Mobile App**
- The request contains:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 43,
    "problemId": 91,
    "language": "java",
    "code": "..."
  }
  ```

## 2. Primary Backend (BE) Processing
- The request is sent to the **Primary Backend (BE)**, which handles:
  - `/problems` â†’ Problem-related data
  - `/contest` â†’ Contest-related data
  - `/profile` â†’ User profile data
- The backend processes the request and forwards it to the **Queue**.

## 3. Queue System
- The **Queue** ensures smooth processing and distributes tasks efficiently to **Workers (w1, w2, etc.)**.
- The workers execute the submitted code on LeetCodeâ€™s servers.

## 4. Publishing Execution Results
- Once execution is complete, the result is published via a **Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) system**.
- Example result:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 43,
    "problemId": 91,
    "language": "java",
    "status": "TLE"
  }
  ```
- This result is sent to users subscribed to updates for `userId: 43`.

## 5. WebSocket (WS) Result Delivery
- The user's browser or mobile app **subscribes** to their execution results via WebSockets (`WS1`, `WS2`, `WS3`).
- WebSockets push the response back to the userâ€™s interface in **real-time**.

## Final Output
- The user sees their submission result (e.g., **Accepted, TLE, Wrong Answer**) instantly.

## Benefits of This Architecture
âœ… **Efficient handling of high traffic**  
âœ… **Real-time updates for users**  
âœ… **Optimized execution via queueing & worker distribution**

# Understanding the Architecture: Key Questions and Explanations

## 1. Why are we not running user code in our primary backend? Why are we delegating the task of running code to workers?

### Explanation  
Running user-submitted code directly on the primary backend poses several risks, including:  
- **Performance issues** â€“ Inefficient or resource-heavy user code can slow down the entire backend.  
- **Security vulnerabilities** â€“ Malicious or infinite loops in user code could crash the system, impacting all users.  

### Solution  
To prevent these issues, we delegate code execution to **workers**, which are independent processing units designed for handling such tasks.  

### How Scaling Works  
Workers are dynamically scaled based on the **queue length** to ensure efficient resource usage:  
- **If the queue length is 100 â†’ Scale up to 20 workers**  
- **If the queue length is 3 â†’ Scale down to 1 worker**  

This ensures that the **primary backend remains available and responsive** while workers handle the compute-intensive operations.

## 2. Why are we using a queue system?

### Explanation  
A **queue system** helps in managing and processing multiple submissions efficiently. Instead of executing user code instantly, the queue organizes and schedules tasks systematically.  

### Benefits of a Queue System  
- **Orderly execution** â€“ Tasks are processed in sequence, avoiding bottlenecks.  
- **Prevents system overload** â€“ Manages sudden spikes in requests without crashing the system.  
- **Ensures priority-based execution** â€“ For example, **premium users** may get faster execution times.  

### Scaling with the Queue System  
- If the number of pending tasks increases, more workers are **automatically** added.  
- When the load reduces, workers **scale down**, saving resources.

## 3. Why do we need Pub/Sub to share responses with the client?

### Explanation  
A **Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) system** is used for real-time communication between the backend and clients. Since a **user may be logged in on multiple devices** (e.g., browser and mobile), both devices should receive the same update simultaneously.  

### How Pub/Sub Helps  
- When a user submits a request, they **subscribe** to a specific topic, such as `"user:1"`.  
- Once the task is completed, the backend **publishes** the response to that topic.  
- All devices **listening** to `"user:1"` receive the update instantly.  

### Key Benefits  
âœ… Real-time updates on all devices.  
âœ… Eliminates the need for **polling**, reducing backend load.  
âœ… Improves the overall **user experience**.

## 4. What are workers? Does each worker process each user's code one at a time?

### Explanation  
**Workers** are independent processing units that execute user-submitted code. The number of workers is dynamically adjusted based on the queue length to ensure efficient execution.  

### Worker Execution Model  
Workers can process tasks in different ways, depending on the system design:  
- **Single-threaded** â€“ Each worker processes **one** task at a time.  
- **Multi-threaded** â€“ A worker can execute **multiple** tasks concurrently.  

### Why This is Efficient  
- Prevents the **primary backend** from being overloaded.  
- Allows **better resource utilization** by running multiple tasks in parallel when needed.  
- Ensures **scalability** â€“ more workers can be added during high demand and reduced during low activity.  

---

## Conclusion  
By using a **combination of workers, a queue system, and Pub/Sub**, the system is designed for:  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Dynamic worker allocation based on queue length.  
âœ… **Efficiency** â€“ Ordered task processing without overloading the backend.  
âœ… **Real-time Updates** â€“ Pub/Sub ensures users get instant responses across all devices.
